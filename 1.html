<strong><li>The plot of a movie</li></strong>
<p style="margin-top:15px" style="margin-bottom:15px">The whole city in this movie was thrown into confusion.
  Some people seems to be suffering from unexplained illnesses.
<br>The people attacked the public like zombie. They are very aggressive and eat people like a starving animal.
<br>The couple who are the leading actors in this movie, 박신혜(유빈) and 유아인(준우) were isolated in their apartment
structured corridor-type building system.
<br>They trapped in their several homes surrounded by zombies and became tired.
<br>Finally they tried to escape into space and fought with zombies by pulling together...
</p>
<strong><li>character traits of two main actors</li></strong>
<p style="margin-top:15px" style="margin-bottom:15px">
'준우' represent today's younger and digital generation. he has warm hearts and a little bold.
<br>'유빈' is a staid character and shows confidence and a strategic decision for surmounting their crisis.
  </ul>
<strong><li>Behind story</li></strong>
<p style="margin-top:15px" style="margin-bottom:15px">
  <ul>
    <li>One of the main actor, 유아인(준우) showed his hair in a state of short and bleached. Actually he supposed to wear a long wig but the director thought that it looks better on 준우 character in the movie than wig.</li>
  <li>The background in this movie is an apartment complex in 여의도. It is structured as corridor-type building system which is quite unusual these days.
    The director was intended to show both sense of freshment from the young and familiarity at 30 years of age.</li>
<li>To express the digital age, there are a lot of factors such as concept of pro-youtuber, communication with SNS, utilization of drone at a time of crisis.</li>
  </ul>
